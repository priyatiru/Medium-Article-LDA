# Medium-Article-LDA
This repository contains files of the project titled - Topic Modeling of medium articles using LDA.

### DATASET
The *medium_data.csv* is the chosen data set for the project. It can be found here - https://www.kaggle.com/dorianlazar/medium-articles-dataset

The dataset contains information about randomly chosen medium articles published in 2019 from these 7 publications:
- Towards Data Science
- UX Collective
- The Startup
- The Writing Cooperative
- Data Driven Investor
- Better Humans
- Better Marketing

### Observations and Conclusions made- 
                       topic       claps
* 0       Deep Learning and AI  263.275862
* 1      General Data Analysis  302.196507
* 2  Machine Learning Modeling  286.637255

It was found out that hese were the topics which were more likely to get attention. This was based in the number of claps.

The project also focused on finding which publication is the most popular.
Obersvations were-
-  The Startup ranks the #1 
- Towards Data Science ranks #2

Later we figured out if posting articles or writing for Towars Data Science worth or not.
This was done by calculating the average reponses each publication gets i.e., the number of claps and the analysis concluded that writing for
Better Humans was more worth than writing for Towards Data Science as it had got more readers( which was in terms of the reactions- claps).

###PS - Thanks to Dorian Lazar for the data set and motivation for the project. I just tried the same.
